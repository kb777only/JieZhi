 *
 * ⚠⚠ **Residency is the whole point.** `../Neodragon`'s video loop visits three
 * ~1.5 GB MMDiT contexts on every autoregressive unit; deserialising one per
 * call would cost more than the render. [handleOf] is paid once per binary and
 * the context stays live until [release]. Its residency probe had all three
 * co-resident in 3.58 GB with ~1.5 GB spare.
 *
 * ⚠ Keyed by **absolute path**, not by a short name. A second naming scheme
 * ("which suffix does this arch use?") is a thing that can disagree with the
 * download manifest, and the manifest is the only list that has to be right.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ Every method blocks and several of them for seconds. Call from a worker.

     * there. The in-process path sets `ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH` where the backend
     * process sets `DSP_LIBRARY_PATH`, and both reach the same files.
     *
     * ⚠ It also means the arch follows the DEVICE, not the binary. A context
     * compiled for v79 running on a v81 phone uses the **V81** skel — which is
     * exactly the forward-compatibility `docs/DEVICES.md` §2 describes, and the
