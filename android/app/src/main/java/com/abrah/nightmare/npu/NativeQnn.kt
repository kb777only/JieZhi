/**
 * ⭐⭐ The app's second route to the NPU: a QNN context binary run **in this
 * process**, with no backend server and no checkpoint bound at launch.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ It does not replace [com.abrah.nightmare.BackendProcess]. That is a
 * separate process holding one `(type, model, resolution)` key for its whole
 * life (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §4); this loads one context binary at a time and
 * joins no key at all — the `/upscale` pattern, minus the HTTP hop. Which one a
 * node uses is decided by what the node is: an SD graph needs the resident
 * pipeline, a standalone context binary does not.
 *
 * ⚠ Every call is by tensor **NAME**, matched against the binary's own
 * metadata. The converter is free to reorder graph inputs, so binding by
 * position feeds the wrong tensor — and a wrong tensor does not fail, it
 * produces a plausible picture.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ **Nothing here is safe to call from the main thread.** [load] deserialises
 * up to 1.5 GB and [execute] is the render. The native side takes one global
 * lock, so concurrent calls serialise rather than race.
 *
 * ⇒ `app/src/main/cpp/nmqnn.cpp` for why in-process at all, and
 * `docs/NEODRAGON.md` for what runs on it.
