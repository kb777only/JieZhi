/**
 * ⭐⭐ Can THIS phone run the video models — answered before an 8.5 GB download.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ **A real context binary, not an allowlist.** The gate is a 58 KB graph in
 * the APK that is loaded and executed. A `Build.SOC_MODEL` allowlist is a guess
 * about which chips carry which Hexagon revision; it goes stale with every new
 * part, and it is exactly the test `../LocalDream/docs/DEVICE-SUPPORT.md` says
 * is the wrong one ("8 Gen 2 or newer" names a chip, not a capability).
 * Loading a context proves the backend, the skel and the architecture actually
 * agree — which is the only question that matters.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ **This is what makes "gen 4 and gen 5" one answer rather than two.** The
 * canary is built for **v79**, and a QNN context runs on the arch it was built
 * for and every newer one (`docs/DEVICES.md` §2). So 8 Elite (v79) loads it,
 * 8 Elite Gen 5 (v81) loads it, and an 8 Gen 3 refuses it — with no version
 * table here to maintain, and no phone silently getting garbage instead of a
 * refusal. ⚠ The v81 half is **reasoned, not measured**: nothing in this
 * project has run on a non-v79 phone, and the canary is precisely how the first
 * such phone will say so honestly.
 *
 * ⚠ It also checks **fp16 arithmetic**, because two of the shipping graphs are
 * float and the HTP runs float graphs in fp16 with no fp32 upcast in the layer
 * norm. A device where fp16 misbehaves returns plausible-looking garbage rather
 * than an error, so the output is compared against a host fp32 reference —
 * `../Neodragon`'s trap #3, where an unscaled DistilT5 build once returned 74%
 * NaN on device.
