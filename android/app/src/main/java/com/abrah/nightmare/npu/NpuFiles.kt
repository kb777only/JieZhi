 * ⚠⚠ `../Neodragon` ships the `assets/` half **inside its APK**, and copying that
 * here was measured and rejected: `mmdit_temb.ndw` (33 MB) plus
 * `ssd1b_addembed.ndw` (21 MB) roughly DOUBLE a 58 MB APK — permanently, for
 * everyone, whether or not they ever make a video (`docs/ROADMAP.md` §3c). They
 * are data, not code, so they join the download the way a checkpoint does.
 *
 * ⚠ The ONE exception is the canary ([NpuCanary]), which is what decides whether
 * to start the download and therefore cannot be in it. 58 KB.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ **`ctx/` is not [com.abrah.nightmare.ModelCatalog]'s tree, deliberately.**
 * A checkpoint there is a directory whose family is INFERRED from its CLIP files
 * and whose required-file list is per family (`docs/MODELS.md` §3b). The video
 * path is 13 flat context binaries with no family to infer and no `--type` to
 * launch; forcing it into that shape would mean teaching the catalogue about a
 * kind of model it cannot describe, and the scan would report a broken import.
